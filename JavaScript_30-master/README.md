# JavaScript 30
<b>Wes Bos' Free 30 Days of JS Projects.</b>

I'm doing these JS projects to focus and practive Vanilla JS to get a better understanding of the 
language and logic.

1. JS DrumKit<br> 
This is a webpage that links sounds to specific keys pressed. 
The letters are specified on the page with a description of the sounds they render.

2. JS (Updating) Clock<br> 
This is a webpage that has the current time updating with a "positive go get it" quote.
I didn't like the Web Bos' version of the clock, so I did it in this version, thought it 
looked cooler.

3. JS CSS Variables<br> 
This is a webpage that changes the spacing, blue, and color using CSS variables. :root is used to
set global CSS Variables and JS addEventHandlers are used to initiate the changes.
